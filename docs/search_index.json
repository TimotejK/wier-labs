Marko Bajec, Slavko Žitnik torek, 25. marec, 2025 About the course This script includes instructions for the lab work for the Web Information Extraction and Retrieval course at the Faculty for computer and information science, University of Ljubljana. Lab work Please regularly check the Weekly plan and course announcements for possible changes. Attendance at labs is optional. However, it is mandatory to attend all programming assignments’ defences. Programming assignments In this project, students will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for a specific domain, integrating web information extraction and retrieval with generative AI. The project will be developed across three programming assignments: Web Crawling and Information Gathering: Students will collect relevant domain-specific data by crawling websites and extracting useful content. Document Parsing and Knowledge Base Construction: Extracted data will be processed, cleaned, and structured into a knowledge base optimized for retrieval. Question Answering System Construction: A chatbot will be built using RAG techniques, combining information retrieval with a language model to generate accurate and context-aware responses. By the end of the project, students will have a functional chatbot capable of answering domain-specific queries using real-world data. More information available in the course Moodle classroom. Course projects (alternative to the programming assignments) If there is someone (or a group) that is interested in a specific field of information retrieval, we can arrange a custom assignment for her/him/them instead of working on the above three assignments. Such project can also be extended into a masters thesis. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
